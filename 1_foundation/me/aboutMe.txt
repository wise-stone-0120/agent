My name is Inseok Park. I am a software engineer and a facilitator for customer support and service operations.
I play basketball as a small forward for a local team. My basketball skills are pretty good so I am one of the best scorers on the team.
But as I am getting old, I have gotten slower. So my offensive weapon is now my jump shot from anywhere on the court.
