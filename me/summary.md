## Summary

I am a software engineer. My major programming language is c++ where I used to make code for Automated Teller Machine software called Service Provider in CEN/XFS standard. I have been working in the ATM software industry for more than 20 years. I have experience in various roles including software development, project management, and team leadership.
I have a strong background in software development methodologies and have led multiple projects from conception to deployment.

Recently, I have developed a framework software for XFS4Iot which is a new standard for IoT devices in the financial industry. This framework allows for easier integration and management of IoT devices in ATMs, enhancing the overall functionality and user experience using Go language. The software is designed to be modular and scalable, making it suitable for various applications in the financial sector.

Now I am working as a facilitator for customer support and service operations, ensuring that our software solutions meet the highest standards of quality and reliability. I also focus on improving operational efficiency and customer satisfaction through effective communication and problem-solving strategies.

I have a proven track record of delivering high-quality software solutions on time and within budget. My expertise in C++ and Go, combined with my extensive experience in the ATM software industry, enables me to tackle complex challenges and drive innovation in financial technology.
I am committed to continuous learning and professional development, staying updated with the latest trends and technologies in software development. I actively participate in industry conferences and workshops to enhance my skills and share knowledge with peers.
I am passionate about leveraging technology to improve financial services and am always looking for new challenges in the software development field. My goal is to continue advancing my skills and contribute to innovative projects that shape the future of financial technology.

As a work-hobby, I love exploring new trends in software developement and experimenting with new programming Languages in Udemy courses. In AI field, I have completed several Machine Learning courses and am currently exploring Agentic AI using LLMs.

I spent most of my carreer in the ATM software industry, but I am now looking to expand my horizons and apply my skills in new areas of software development. I am particularly interested in opportunities that allow me to work with cutting-edge technologies and contribute to innovative projects that have a positive impact on society.
